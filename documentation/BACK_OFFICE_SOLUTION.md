# Back Office Solution for Fantasy Character Creator

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive solution for developing an administration panel (back office) for the Fantasy Character Creator project.

## Project Context
- **Current Project**: Fantasy Character Creator
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, Express, React
- **Existing Infrastructure**: 
  - Backend with Express
  - Redis for caching
  - Static file serving for character avatars

## Back Office Solution Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
- Create multi-level admin user management

#### Key Authentication Features
- Admin user creation and management
- Secure login mechanism
- Role-based access restrictions

### 2. Backend Enhancements

#### New Routes
- `/admin/users`: User management
- `/admin/characters`: Character management
- `/admin/avatars`: Avatar management
- `/admin/settings`: System configuration

#### Middleware Requirements
- Admin access verification
- Request validation
- Logging and auditing

### 3. Admin Dashboard Features

#### User Management
- List all users
- Create new users
- Edit user details
- Delete users
- View user activity logs
- Manage user roles and permissions

#### Character Management
- View all created characters
- Edit character details
- Delete characters
- Export character data
- Character generation statistics

#### Avatar Management
- Browse uploaded avatars
- Delete unused avatars
- Set avatar generation rules
- Avatar usage analytics

#### System Settings
- Manage application configurations
- Configure character generation parameters
- Set up rate limits
- Manage usage quotas
- Environment-specific settings

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Authentication Middleware (Pseudocode)
```typescript
const isAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && req.user.role === 'ADMIN') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied' });
  }
};
```

#### Proposed Routes Structure
```typescript
// Admin user routes
adminRoutes.get('/users', isAdmin, getUsersList);
adminRoutes.post('/users', isAdmin, createUser);
adminRoutes.put('/users/:id', isAdmin, updateUser);
adminRoutes.delete('/users/:id', isAdmin, deleteUser);

// Character management routes
adminRoutes.get('/characters', isAdmin, getAllCharacters);
adminRoutes.delete('/characters/:id', isAdmin, deleteCharacter);
```

### 5. Security Considerations
- Implement robust authentication
- Use HTTPS
- Add two-factor authentication
- Comprehensive logging
- Regular security audits
- Credential rotation
- Input validation

### 6. Recommended Tech Stack Additions
- `passport.js`: Authentication
- `jsonwebtoken`: Token management
- `winston`: Logging
- `joi` or `zod`: Input validation

### 7. Development Roadmap
1. Authentication middleware implementation
2. Admin-specific route development
3. Frontend admin dashboard creation
4. Role-based access control
5. Logging and monitoring setup

### 8. Estimated Development Timeline
- Backend routes and middleware: 2-3 days
- Authentication system: 1-2 days
- Admin dashboard: 3-5 days
- Testing and security hardening: 2-3 days

## Conclusion
This solution provides a comprehensive, secure, and scalable back office system for the Fantasy Character Creator, enabling robust administration and management capabilities.
